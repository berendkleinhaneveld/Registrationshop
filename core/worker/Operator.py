    """
    Operator is an operator of command. It creates a queue of commands.
    Each command should be a subclass of the type Command. For each type
    there is a specific kind of operator that will be called to process the
    command.

    An operator collects all the commands that are 'fired'. There are one or more
    workers that wait until commands are given to the queue of commands. These
    workers will process the commands, depending on the type of command.

    Command pattern:
